## What IRSIE Does :
IRSIE transforms complex tax regulations into programmatic answers. Built by fine-tuning transformer models on the complete IRS regulatory corpus, it provides authoritative tax interpretations with source citations through a production API.

## Core Capabilities :
- **Tax Code Interpretation**: Natural language queries return precise regulatory guidance
- **Form Processing**: Automated analysis of W-2, 1099, and standard tax forms  
- **Compliance Validation**: Deterministic calculations using official IRS methodologies
- **Source Attribution**: Every response includes exact regulatory citations

## Target Applications :
- Enterprise payroll compliance systems
- Tax professional research platforms
- Real estate investment calculators
- Small business automation tools
- Financial advisory tax planning modules

## Min Performance SLAs : 
- **Inference Latency**: P95 < 200ms per query
- **Accuracy**: 94.2% on IRS compliance benchmarks
- **Availability**: 99.9% API uptime
- **Throughput**: 1,000+ concurrent queries supported

## Technical Specifications

### Model Architecture
- **Base**: Fine-tuned transformer (12 layers, 768d hidden, 12 attention heads)
- **Training Data**: 2.8B tokens from complete IRS documentation (2020-2024)
- **Context Window**: 2,048 tokens maximum
- **Vocabulary**: 32,000 tokens (expanded for tax terminology)

### System Components
```
Query Input → Classification → Document Retrieval → 
Model Inference → Validation → Cited Response
```

### Infrastructure
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone with 384d embeddings
- **Document Corpus**: 847 IRS publications with semantic chunking
- **Retrieval**: RAG with cross-encoder reranking
- **Framework**: PyTorch + Hugging Face Transformers

### Training Pipeline
1. **Data Extraction**: Complete Tax Code and IRS publications preprocessing
2. **Semantic Chunking**: Citation-linked document segments
3. **Fine-tuning**: Task-specific heads for classification and generation
4. **RLHF Optimization**: Human feedback for compliance accuracy
5. **Validation**: Deterministic calculation layer for numerical accuracy

### API Interface
```python
POST /api/tax/query
{
  "query": "What are the 2024 401k contribution limits?",
  "tax_year": 2024,
  "context": "individual"
}

Response:
{
  "answer": "The 2024 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000...",
  "sources": ["IRS Publication 560, Section 3.2"],
  "confidence": 0.96,
  "calculations": {...}
}
```
